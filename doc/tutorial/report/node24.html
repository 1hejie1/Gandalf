Error handling
</H1>
<PRE>
      #include &lt;gandalf/common/gan_err.h&gt;
</PRE>
The purpose of the error module is to provide a
mechanism by which generic reusable code (typically a software library) can
report errors to a variety of applications without the need to
modify the library code for each new application context. That is,
the error reporting mechanism of the library is highly decoupled
from that of the application. Communication of error information
from library to application is performed using a small and well
defined interface.

<P>
The role of the library is to communicate full and
unprocessed error information to the application. The role of the
application is to access the error information and act on it, whether
reporting the error back to the user, ignore it or perform some other action.
This demarcation of roles allows the application to use its
own error reporting mechanism, without any need to embed application
specific code in the library. The library achieves generality
because it plays no role in reporting the error information, which
usually requires system and application specific facilities.
Specifically, the library writes (registers) error information into
a LIFO stack (error trace) which is built up as the error unwinds
through the nested calls. When the library function called by the
application finally returns, with an error code, the application
uses an error reporter to access the errors details and processes
that information in any way it chooses (e.g. displays an error
dialogue box, logs the error in a database).

<P>
The library function at which a new error occurs must first flush
the error trace before registering the error.

<P>
When using the error handling code the following definitions are useful.
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Error record:</B> a struct holding error code, file name, line
	number, and text message for one error.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Error trace:</B> a LIFO stack of error records, which allows
	temporary storage of error information until defered retrieval by
	application.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Top record:</B> The most recent error stored in trace.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Error detection:</B> Code that detects occurrence of an error.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Error handling:</B> Action undertaken as a result of detecting an
	error. In library this typically involves registering the error and
	returning from current function with an error status. In application
        this typically involves invoking the reporter function.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Registering:</B> The process of placing an error into the trace
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Flushing:</B> The clearing of the error trace
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><B>Reporter:</B> A function provided by the application to access error
        stored in trace and then communicating that information
        to the user or to a log. The reporter function must then
        flush the error trace.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
To illustrate the use of the error handling package, consider an example
application which calls library (Gandalf or other) function A, which itself
calls library function B, which has an error that is detected.
Function B ``flushes'' the ``error trace'' (because it is
the last function called that uses the facilities of the error package),
and then ``registers'' the error details into the error trace and unwinds
to function A with a return value that indicates an error has occurred.
Function A tests the return value and detects the error, and then registers
an error into the trace and unwinds to the application with a return value
which indicates that an error has occurred. The application tests the return
value and detects that an error has occurred, so calls a facility in the
error package to report the error. The error report function in
turn calls an application-supplied error ``reporter'' function with
a pointer to the error trace as an argument. The address of the
error trace is stored as a module scoped variable in the error package
The reporter accesses the information contained in
the error trace using accessor functions, and communicates the
error details to the user or to a log in some application specific way
(or it may ignore the error or perform some other action).

<P>
Consequences and liabilities:

<OL>
<LI>The application is able to:

<UL>
<LI>control when errors are reported to the user interface 
             (the library should not itself report errors to the user)
</LI>
<LI>provide its own error reporting mechanism 
             (to suit its own user interface).
</LI>
<LI>extract sufficient information from the library to
             enable sufficient error reporting to be performed.
    
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>The library can be used with many applications, without modification.
</LI>
<LI>Interactive resolution of errors occurring in library is problematic.
      Essentially the library is a black box to the application.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Usage notes for application writer: No
code is needed to initialise the error trace. But a error reporting
function is optionally installed in the error module using
<TT>gan_err_set_reporter()</TT>. The reporter is an application function of
type <TT>Gan_ErrorReporterFunc</TT>, which is defined in <TT>gan_err.h</TT>. The
reporter must get the error count using <TT>gan_err_get_error_count()</TT>
and then sequentially access the errors stored in the trace using
<TT>gan_err_get_error(n)</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is the <TT>n</TT>-th error,
and <TT>n=1</TT> is the most
recent error. If no error reporter is installed, then the error
module provides a default reporter <TT>gan_err_default_reporter()</TT>, whose
action is to print the error details into <TT>stderr</TT>. The function call
<TT>gan_err_set_reporter(GAN_ERR_DFL)</TT> causes the default error reporter
to be used, and the call <TT>gan_err_set_reporter(GAN_ERR_IGN)</TT> inhibits
the error reporter from being called. <TT>gan_err_set_reporter()</TT> returns
the address of the error reporter that was replaced so that it can
be reinstalled later.

<P>
When the application tests the return value of a library function
and detects that an error has occurred, it should call <TT>gan_err_report()</TT>
which invokes the error reporter.

<P>
The application writer can choose not to buffer the error details in
a trace, but instead have the library function report errors
immediately, by automatically calling <TT>gan_err_report()</TT> inside
<TT>gan_err_register()</TT>. No error trace is built up. If the application
calls <TT>gan_err_report()</TT>, no errors are reported because the trace will
be empty. Usage of the trace is controlled by <TT>gan_err_set_trace()</TT> with
arguments <TT>GAN_ERR_TRACE_ON</TT> or <TT>GAN_ERR_TRACE_OFF</TT>.

<P>
Usage notes for library writer: When a
error is detected at the deepest function call that uses the
facilities of the error module, then <TT>gan_err_flush_trace()</TT> should be
called, followed by <TT>gan_err_register()</TT>. As the subsequent library
function unwinds, they should call <TT>gan_err_register()</TT> (but not
<TT>gan_err_flush_trace()</TT>), and return with an error code. This
continues until the call stack unwinds into the applicaton.

<P>
Multi-thread safe: A programmer attempting to use this module in a
multithreaded system must heed all precautions attendent with using
fully share memory address spaces. To make this module multithread
safe, global locks must used to prevent concurrent access to the
error trace.
